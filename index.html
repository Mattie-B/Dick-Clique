                was created in April 1940 in Detective Comics #38 as the first, Robin, the Boy
                Wonder. Robin would work with Batman for many years and go on many adventures
                with him as well as a team of superheroes called the Teen Titans. Dick would
                eventually strike out on his own, but when his team is in distress, he 
                comes out of retirement and adopts the new identity of Nightwing in Tales
                of the Teen Titans #43 in 1984 by Marv Wolfman and George Perez. Dick Grayson has
                gone by many aliases over the years such as Robin, Red Robin, Renegade, Red X,
                The Target, Batman, Agent 37, but his most iconic by far is,"Nightwing." Dick Grayson
                has been a sidekick, partner, leader, mentor, but his main priorty will always be
                the safety and security of others.
