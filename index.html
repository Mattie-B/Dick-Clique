                Richard "Dick" John Grayson, is an acrobat trained from birth in
                the trapeze act the Flying Grayson's at Haly's Circus. Dick is a half Romaini
                and half White, 5'10 male, living in the city of Bludhaven. Dick Grayson
                was created in April 1940 in Detective Comics #38 as the first, Robin, the Boy
                Wonder. Robin would work with Batman for many years and go on many adventures
                with him as well as a team of superheroes called the Teen Titans. Dick would
                eventually strike out on his own, but when his team is in distress, he 
                comes out of retierment and adopts the new identity of Nightwing in Tales
                of the Teen Titans #43 in 1984 by Marv Wolfman and George Perez. Nightwing
                would later have his own city to protect called Bludhaven and slowly
                grows into his own hero.
